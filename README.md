# Face-tracking-with-Anime-characters
Hello! I have made a Python project where YURI from the game doki doki literature club accesses the webcam and stares directly into the players soul. Hope you enjoy!

Requirements:
  Have python3 installed. (I have used Python3.6 on python IDLE )
  install OpenCV, os, math, ctypes, time, pygame (you will probably only need to download OpenCV and Pygame)
  
Now get the file "YURI FULLSCREEN.py" from this repository on your computer.
save the yuri2.bmp and eyes images and give the path for these images in the code (you can also use your own waifus if you want)
download haarcascade and give its location in the code.
Run the code and have fun with your waifu ... weeb

Make your own:

you will need only 2 images
1) character without eyes

2) eyes

 just use those images instead and you are good to go!
